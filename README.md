# Mr. Belly

Mr. Belly provides a simple and useful invoice form that, after filled, can be used to generate a PDF file. Access
it [here](https://mobius3.github.io/mr-belly).

Features:

- Supports multiple currencies
- Supports multiple number formats
- Has a pretty (to my eyes ;) PDF output
- Doesn't collect your data
  - In fact your data is stored locally in your browser
- Allows you to export and save your data externally
- Also allows you to restore invoices from exported data
- Works wonderfully in your phone (seriously, try it!)
